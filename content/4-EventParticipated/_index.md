## [Event 1: AI/ML, GenAI & Amazon Bedrock on AWS](4.1-Event1/)

**Event Name:** AI/ML, GenAI & Amazon Bedrock Workshop

**Date & Time:** October 2025

**Location:** AWS Office, Ho Chi Minh City

**Role:** Attendee

**Summary:**

This workshop provided a comprehensive overview of the modern AI stack on AWS, covering everything from traditional machine learning to Foundation Models. Key topics included:

- **Embeddings & RAG**: Understanding vector representations and Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines
- **Prompt Engineering**: Techniques like zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting
- **Amazon Bedrock Agents**: Agent Core orchestration, Browser Tool for real-time web access
- **AWS AI Services**: Rekognition, Textract, Transcribe, Translate, Polly, Comprehend

**Key Takeaways:**
- GenAI is a full system architecture, not just a single model
- RAG + Embeddings form the foundation for enterprise GenAI solutions
- Better prompts lead to better AI outcomes

## [Event 2: DevOps on AWS](4.2-Event2/)

**Event Name:** DevOps on AWS Workshop

**Date & Time:** November 2025

**Location:** AWS Office, Ho Chi Minh City

**Role:** Attendee

**Summary:**

This workshop focused on modern DevOps practices and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) on AWS. The sessions covered:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Benefits of automation, scalability, and reproducibility
- **AWS CloudFormation**: YAML/JSON templates, stacks, drift detection
- **AWS CDK**: Programming-based IaC with construct levels (L1, L2, L3)
- **Docker & Containers**: Dockerfile workflows, image management
- **AWS Container Services**: ECR, ECS, EKS, and App Runner

**Key Takeaways:**
- IaC eliminates manual configuration drift and human errors
- CDK enables faster development with reusable patterns
- ECS is ideal for simplicity; EKS for full Kubernetes capabilities
- App Runner provides quick deployment with minimal DevOps overhead
