## Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**

The atmosphere at the workplace was welcoming and supportive throughout my internship. Team members from FCJ were always approachable and ready to assist whenever I faced challenges, even beyond regular working hours. The office space was well-organized and conducive to productivity. One suggestion I have is to organize more informal gatherings or team-building events to help strengthen interpersonal connections among team members.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**

My mentor provided thorough and patient guidance, taking time to explain concepts clearly whenever I had questions. I was always encouraged to voice my uncertainties without hesitation. The administrative team was equally helpful, ensuring all necessary paperwork and resources were readily available. What I valued most was my mentor's approach of letting me attempt problem-solving independently before offering solutions, which greatly enhanced my learning experience.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**

The assignments I received were closely related to my university coursework, while also exposing me to unfamiliar topics and technologies. This combination allowed me to reinforce my existing knowledge while simultaneously developing new practical competencies that will be valuable in my career.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**

Throughout the internship, I acquired numerous new abilities including proficiency with project management tools, effective teamwork strategies, and professional communication practices in a corporate setting. My mentor generously shared insights from their professional journey, which provided me with valuable perspective for planning my future career direction.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**

The organizational culture was remarkably positive—characterized by mutual respect, dedication to quality work, and a pleasant atmosphere. During high-pressure periods with tight deadlines, everyone collaborated seamlessly regardless of their role or seniority. This inclusive environment made me feel like a valued contributor to the team, despite being an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**

The company offered a reasonable internship stipend along with flexibility in working hours when circumstances required it. Additionally, the opportunity to participate in internal training programs was an excellent benefit that enhanced my professional development.
